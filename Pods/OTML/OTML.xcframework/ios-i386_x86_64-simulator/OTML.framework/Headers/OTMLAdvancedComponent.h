 @discussion hook method for the view update logic.
             The main responsibility of this method is to perform changes on the subviews to reflect changes on the model.
             This method is called exactly one time after component creation (immediatelly after createAndAppendCustomViewsToContentView:).
             This method is called at least one time for every update action executed on the component iff any property of the model is changed
             since last call of this method.
             E.G: a text in a Label or a UIKeyboardType for a textfield.
 @warning as well as any other hook method, this is supposed to be overridden. Default implementation is no-op.
